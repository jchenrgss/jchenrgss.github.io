$\textbf{Introduction and Evidence}$
<p>
The Aichi D3A "Val" was the primary dive bomber of the IJN, and has sank more Allied warships than any other Axis aircraft, despite being considered obsolete at the start of the war. D3As started their bombing runs at a medium altitude, dove at the target at approximately 70 degrees, released their bombs at a low altitude, and then pulled out of their dive. By releasing their bombs in a steep dive, the path of the bomb was greatly simplified and allowed for significantly greater accuracy. Here, I will consider the scenario that D3As dive bombed the Arizona, causing it to sink.
</p>
<p>
The D3As at Pearl Harbor were equipped with a single 250-kg bomb, as well as two 60-kg bombs.<br><br>

$\textbf{Conclusion}$
<p>
Based on the evidence that a bomb was dropped from 3,000 m (falling for 26 seconds and travelling a horizontal distance of approximately 2,600 m), it is likely that this is how Arizona was sunk. In addition to this, the final impact angle and velocity would be appropriate for penetrating the deck of the ship and hitting the ammunition magazines underneath the gun turret. Although this scenario does seem similar and nearly identical to the first (Nagato), it is more realistic, because from an evidence-based standpoint, more than half a hundred B5Ns were spotted in the sky, allowing for a much greater chance of hitting the ship.
