$\textbf{Introduction}$
<p>
The USS <i>Arizona</i> was a <i>Pennylvania</i>-class battleship that was stationed with the US Navy's Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbour during World War II. However, on the morning of 7 December 1941, <i>Arizona</i> was bombed by Japanese aircraft, causing it to explode violently and sink, leading to the loss of 1,177 people. Unlike the many other ships that were damaged or sunk during the attack, <i>Arizona</i> was irreparably damaged and could not be repaired. The wreck continues to lie at the bottom of Pearl Harbour today, and rests below a memorial to those who died.<br>

During the attack, four hits and three near misses on the <i>Arizona</i> were observed. The near misses caused observers to initially believe that the ship had been torpedoed, but no torpedo damage was found, immediately ruling out Japanese submarines and torpedo bombers as suspects. A ricochet mark was found on the face of one of the gun turrets with a hole in the deck beside it, another hole was found near the anti-torpedo bulkhead near the port edge of the ship, and a last hole was fond near the port rear 5-inch antiaircraft gun. The last hit on the <i>Arizona</i> likely penetrated the deck near the forward ammunition magazine, because it detonated in a large explosion, causing the ship to collapse and tear in half.<br><br>

From these pieces of evidence, several possible scenarios can be devised: the Japanese battleship <i>Nagato</i>'s shells from its primary cannons hit and sank the <i>Arizona</i> (unlikely), <i>Val</i> dive bombers hit the ship from a low altitude (likely), or <i>Kate</i> bombers dropped modified 800-kg bombs from a medium altitude (very likely). Using knowledge of motion and dynamics, it is possible to accurately determine how the <i>Arizona</i>was sunk. For example, the range equation can be used to determine if it was possible for the <i>Nagato</i>'s guns to hit the <i>Arizona</i> at one particular spot, the kinematics equations can be used to determine the flight path of falling bombs, and Newton's laws of motion can explain why the ship exploded so catastophically.
