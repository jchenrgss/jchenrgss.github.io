$\textbf{Introduction}$
<p>
The USS <i>Arizona</i> was a <i>Pennylvania</i>-class battleship that was stationed with the US Navy's Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbour during World War II. However, on the morning of 7 December 1941, <i>Arizona</i> was bombed by Japanese aircraft, causing it to explode violently and sink, leading to the loss of 1,177 people. Unlike the many other ships that were damaged or sunk during the attack, <i>Arizona</i> was irreparably damaged and could not be repaired. The wreck continues to lie at the bottom of Pearl Harbour today, and rests below a memorial to those who died.
</p>
<p>
During the attack, four hits and three near misses on the <i>Arizona</i> were observed. The near misses caused observers to initially believe that the ship had been torpedoed, but no torpedo damage was found, immediately ruling out Japanese submarines and torpedo bombers as suspects. A ricochet mark was found on the face of one of the gun turrets with a hole in the deck beside it, another hole was found near the anti-torpedo bulkhead near the port edge of the ship, and a last hole was fond near the port rear 5-inch antiaircraft gun.
