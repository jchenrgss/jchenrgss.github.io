$\textbf{Introduction}$
<p>
The USS Arizona was a Pennsylvania-class battleship that was stationed with the US Navy's Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbour during World War II. However, on the morning of 7 December 1941, Arizona was bombed by Japanese aircraft, causing it to explode violently and sink, leading to the deaths of 1,177 people. Unlike the many other ships that were damaged or sunk during the attack, Arizona was irreparably damaged and could not be repaired. Today, the wreck continues to lie at the bottom of Pearl Harbour, and rests below a memorial for those who died.<br><br>

<p>
During the attack, four hits and three near misses on Arizona were recorded. The near misses caused observers to initially believe that the ship had been torpedoed, but later, no torpedo damage was found, immediately ruling out Japanese submarines and torpedo bombers as suspects. A ricochet mark was found on the face of one of the gun turrets with a hole in the deck beside it, another hole was found near the anti-torpedo bulkhead near the port edge of the ship, and the third hole was found near the port rear 5-inch antiaircraft gun. The last hit on the ship penetrated the deck near the forward ammunition magazine, causing a large detonation and leading the ship to collapse and tear in half.

<p>
From these pieces of evidence (quantitative evidence to follow), several possible scenarios can be devised: 1) the Japanese battleship Nagato fired shells from its primary cannons and sank Arizona; 2) "Val" dive bombers hit the ship from a low altitude; or 3) "Kate" torpedo bombers dropped modified 800-kg bombs from a medium altitude. Using knowledge of motion and dynamics, it is possible to accurately determine how the Arizona was sunk. For example, the range equation can be used to determine if it was possible for Nagato's guns to hit Arizona at one particular spot, the kinematics equations can be used to determine the flight paths of falling bombs, and Newton's laws of motion can explain why the ship exploded so catastrophically.<br><br>

$\textbf{Sources of Error}$
<p>
Since only simple physics concepts have been used in this analysis, there are many sources of error, which undoubtedly affect the calculation results. However, they do not affect the conclusions that have been reached regarding the viability of each of the three scenarios. For example, in many of the calculations performed, air resistance was simply ignored. In Nagato's case, this lead to an inaccuracy of nearly 20,000 km (having a significantly greater firing range than possible). Additionally, wind was also not taken into account, because weather reports were not available.
</p>
<p>
For the calculations that used the drag equation, several assumptions were made: 1) rho (air pressure) was kept at a constant 1.225 kg/m^3, despite the altitude; 2) one velocity was used to calculate the drag force (as velocity decreases, drag should also decrease), meaning that drag was constant (this avoids using calculus); 3) drag coefficients were not readily available (using 0.025 as an average for medium-sized turboprops and 0.10 as a low guess from US Army source material); and 4) the reference area was one surface only (wing area; bomb diameter), again trying to avoid the use of calculus.
</p>
<p>
Despite assuming ideal conditions for most calculations, the conclusions were not affected, because logical reasoning was taken into account to reduce the effects of sources of error. In analyses such as this, conclusions should not just be based off of hard numbers; common sense and deduction should be used to explain anomalies and provide alternate, perhaps more realistic possibilities.

$\textbf{Conclusion}$
<p>
Looking through these three scenarios (there are obviously more possibilities, but these three are the most likely), it becomes evident that the second scenario ("Val" dive bombing) is the least likely, due to the lower damage potential of the 250-kg bomb and the increased angle at which the bomb is dropped. Out of the remaining two possibilities, the first scenario (Nagato) is eliminated through strategic reasoning despite having similar quantitative evidence. The last scenario is the most likely (and indeed, the correct one), because of several different reasons: 1) the bomb has enough destructive potential; 2) the bomb hit the deck at an appropriate angle to detonate beneath the gun turret; 3) there were many B5Ns in the sky during the attack; and 4) mid-altitude bombing has the least amount of risk involved.
